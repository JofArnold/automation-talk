## Warning! This Might be Fast


Just remember this URL: [jofarnold.github.io/automation-talk](https://jofarnold.github.io/automation-talk).


Don't worry about taking notes: you probably won't have time.


---


We'll start with some simpler tricks - things you might already know - and work our way up to a few more sophisticated examples.


---


# Command Line Automation

.aside[
NOTE: We've added new lines to many of these commands for readability so you won't be able to directly paste them into your terminal. Convert them to single line commands to use.
]

## Renaming Files

Renaming them one by one in your file explorer is very time consuming. And without automation, the command line takes even longer...

```bash
mv img137.jpg stock-photo-137.jpg
mv img138.jpg stock-photo-138.jpg
mv img139.jpg stock-photo-139.jpg
```


---

class: has-code

## Bulk Renaming Files

```bash
# mv img137.jpg stock-photo-137.jpg
# mv img138.jpg stock-photo-138.jpg
# mv img139.jpg stock-photo-139.jpg

for I in img*.jpg; do
  mv $I ${I/#img/stock-photo-};
done;
```

class: has-code

## Make Thumbnails Using ImageMagick

Runs the ImageMagick `convert` command on matching pngs in that directory

```bash
for I in my-big-photo*.png; do
  convert -resize 20% $I ${I/%.png/.thumb.jpg};
done;
```

## Run Scheduled Tasks With Cron

```bash
min hour day_of_month month day_of_week task_to_run
```

---

class: has-code

## Example:

Pull, rebase and build every hour at 15mins past the hour.


```cron
15 * * * * cd /dev/project
             &amp;&amp; git pull --rebase
             &amp;&amp; npm install
             &amp;&amp; npm run build
```

---

class: has-code

## Example:

Every day at 5pm send your achievements to Slack `#checkins`.

```cron
0 17 * * * cd /dev/project
             &amp;&amp; git standup
             |  slackcli -h "#checkins" -c
```

# Automate Your Editor


---

class: has-code

## Multiple Cursors

Here's an example for Vim, but many other editors such as Sublime, Atom support this too.

.multipleCursors[
![multiple cursors](images/multiple-cursors.gif)
]


---

### Plugin:


```viml
Plug 'terryma/vim-multiple-cursors'
let g:multi_cursor_exit_from_visual_mode = 0
let g:multi_cursor_exit_from_insert_mode = 0
```

[github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors](https://github.com/terryma/vim-multiple-cursors)


---


class: has-code

## Change a Constant Across Every File


```viml
:silent! argdo %s/Foo/Bar/ge
```

Across all files in the `arg` list this `silent`ly `s`ubstitutes the text `Foo` with `Bar` `g`lobally skipping any `e`rrors

## Lint for Code Issues


![eslint](images/lint.png)


Here I'm attempting to reassign foo which is giving me a poop emoji and a error message that I'm doing something we don't allow.

Plugins (Note for Vim users you'll need NeoVim or Vim8 to get the async goodness)

## Other Editor Automation Techniques

There's a lot of other ways of saving typing too. Investigate at your own leisure:

Snippets: e.g. vim-snipmate

File templates: e.g. vim-template

Autocomplete: e.g. YouCompleteMe

# Automate Your Browser


---


## JavaScript Bookmarklets

You can create bookmarks that contain not URLs but JavaScript for quick actions. You simply prefix the command with `javascript:` and put it in the URL field of the bookmark.


---

class: has-code

## Pre-Fill Forms for Testing


![form filler](images/form-filler.gif)

---

Example code:

[jofarnold.github.io/automation-talk/examples/random-form-filler.js](examples/random-form-filler.js)

.aside[
  Note: you'll need to uglify that since the bookmarklets require a single line:
]

[jofarnold.github.io/automation-talk/examples/random-form-filler.ugly.js](examples/random-form-filler.ugly.js)


---

class: has-code

## Clear Local Storage


If you're working with local storage, sometimes cleaning it out is very helpful. It's much quicker via a bookmarklet than using the browser dev tools.


```javascript
javascript:localStorage.clear();window.location.reload();
```


---

class: has-code

## Expand Github Panels

GitHub's panels are of limited width; sometimes this isn't suitable. Horizontal scrolling is a pain - let's fix it:

Make wide:

`javascript:Array.prototype.slice.call( document.querySelectorAll(".file")).forEach( el => {el.style.width = window.innerWidth - 40 + "px";el.style.marginLeft = (980 - (window.innerWidth - 40))/2 + "px"})`


---

class: has-code

Make normal again:

`javascript:Array.prototype.slice.call( document.querySelectorAll(".file")).forEach( el => {el.style.width = '';el.style.marginLeft = ''})`

## Browsersync, Adobe Edge...


Automagically update all your browsers on save.

## Automate Version Control

Dealing with git's confusing upstream settings and creating pull requests on GitHub/Bitbucket can waste valuable seconds. Add to your bash/zsh profile:


---

class: has-code, smaller-code

```bash
# Gets the GitHub URL of the current repo
alias ghurl='git ghurl'

# Pushes the current branch and sets the upstream
alias gpu='git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)'

# As gpu, then opens GitHub create PR for this branch
alias gpupr='git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) &amp;&amp;
  open $(ghurl)/compare/$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)?expand=1'

# As gpupr, but against `production` branch 
# and prepares releasenotes for you!
alias gpuppr='git releasenotes | pbcopy; 
  git push -u origin $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) &amp;&amp;
  open $(ghurl)/compare/production...$(
    git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
  )?expand=1'
```

---


class: has-code, smaller-code

~/.gitconfig:

```ini
[alias]
# Figures out the GitHub URL for this repo
ghurl =! bash -c 'git config --get remote.origin.url |
sed -E "s/.+:\\(.+\\)$/https:\\\\/\\\\/github\\\\.com\\\\/\\\\1/g" |
sed "s/\\.git$//"'

# Takes the merge commits (assuming they're GitHub PRs)
# and tidies them up into release notes
releasenotes = "!git fetch -p >&amp;2 &amp;&amp;
git log --format=\"%s%x09%b\" --merges origin/production...HEAD |
grep -v \"Merge branch 'production'\" |
sed -Ee s'/Merge pull request (#[0-9]+) from [^ '$'\\t'']+/\\1/' |
column -s $'\\t' -t"
```

## Automatically Deploy When Build Passes

circle.yml:

```yaml
[...]
deployment:
  production:
    branch: production
    commands:
      - git push git@heroku.com:YOURAPP.git $CIRCLE_SHA1:master
      - heroku maintenance:on --app YOURAPP
      - heroku run --exit-code 'rake db:migrate' --app YOURAPP
      - heroku maintenance:off --app YOURAPP
```

## Know When Not to Automate

But be careful. It's addictive and not always a good idea. You need to be alert and realistic

## If Your Task is Generic

### [ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com)

More consumer-focussed such as "When I upload to  Twitter also update Facebook and Instagram".

### [zapier.com](https://zapier.com)

More business-focussed such as  "When I get a Stripe payment, create an entry in Salesforce".

## But if You Need Something Custom, Be Careful...

Servers can be a maintenance headache and ongoing cost. We recommend [heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/).

Keeping modules up to date can be a pain. If you've good test coverage, try [greenkeeper.io](https://greenkeeper.io/).

As for keeping up with third party API changes; subscribe to their changelogs?

## Our Challenge to You

For one week, start to list the tasks you're repeating a bit too much...

.aside[
  It could be Github labels; server scaling; upgrading user accounts manually too often...
]

... and then see if there's solutions out there.
